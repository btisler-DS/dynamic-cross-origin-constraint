# Theory

Working documents, literature notes, and paper drafts supporting the
Δ-Variable Theory of Interrogative Emergence.

## Core Claim

Interrogative states are not linguistic phenomena. They are **Δ-variables** — explicitly
represented, unresolved dependency variables that require external information for resolution
and create mandatory coupling between coordinating systems. Under energy constraints, systems
that develop Δ-variable management outperform systems that do not.

This is a structural claim, not a behavioural one. The experiment tests whether the structure
emerges spontaneously under the right conditions, not whether agents can be trained to ask
questions.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Δ-Variable Theory
*Primary source — this project.*

Five propositions:
1. **Structural Necessity** — Interrogative states emerge as optimal solutions to uncertainty
   management, not as linguistic phenomena
2. **Cost-Benefit Optimization** — Systems develop interrogative behaviours despite higher energy
   costs when coordination benefits exceed expenditure
3. **Forced Coupling** — Unresolved Δ-variables create dependency edges requiring inter-system
   coordination
4. **Silent Collapse Prevention** — Systems that act without resolving acknowledged uncertainty
   exhibit coordination failure
5. **Substrate Independence** — Under identical constraints, different cognitive architectures
   converge on similar Δ-management strategies

### AnnA — Adaptive, non-neural Axiom
*Puchtel (2026)*

Formal axiomatic framework for intelligence as coherence under pressure.

Key definitions relevant to this project:
- **Intelligence** = maintenance of coherence under pressure over time
- **Structure** = constraint-bearing residue of interaction
- **Regulation** = redistribution of pressure under constraint

AnnA provides the deductive basis for why Δ-variables *must* emerge: coherence under pressure
requires resolving unresolved dependencies before acting; a Δ-variable is precisely an explicitly
represented unresolved dependency. The experiment confirms what the axioms predict.

Adopted phrasings:
- *"Constraint-bearing residue"* — describes what crystallisation is
- *"Regulation without command"* — describes Agent C's broker function
- *"Pressure redistribution"* — describes the D/Q/R type dynamics

### Intelligence Beyond Neurons
*Puchtel (2026), Chapters 1–6*

Chapter-by-chapter argument that intelligence is not grounded in signals, representation, models,
optimization, control, or prediction. Each chapter provides independent motivation for a
constraint-grounded account.

Relevant to the paper's Related Work section:
- Ch. 1 — Signal-based accounts cannot explain why signal *type* matters
- Ch. 2 — Representation-based accounts cannot explain emergence from energy constraints alone
- Ch. 4 — Optimization-based accounts cannot explain limit-cycle behaviour (non-convergence)
- Ch. 5 — Agent C's GNN broker role as regulation without command

The final pages contain an explicit mapping table from each chapter to Cross-Origin-Constraint
simulation behaviours.

## Literature Gap

Elicit systematic review (2026) screened 50 papers on mathematical foundations of language
emergence. Of 10 included studies, none make the ontological identity claim that language
operations *are* mathematical at the substrate level — all use mathematics as an analytical
tool. This is the gap the Δ-Variable experiment addresses directly.

## Paper Structure (Draft)

1. **Introduction** — The gap; frameworks that approach it; the missing empirical piece
2. **Theoretical Framework** — AnnA axioms → Δ-variable definition follows deductively
3. **Experiment** — Preregistered design; five cost conditions; 15 seeds
4. **Pilot Data** — Run 11 exploratory results (excluded from confirmatory testing)
5. **Results** — Confirmatory experiment
6. **Discussion** — Substrate independence; counter-waves as coherence resets; limit-cycle behaviour
