## Preregistration

**`preregistration.md`** — Locked preregistration for the confirmatory study.

> *Testing Substrate-Independent Emergence of Interrogative Structures Under Resource Constraints
> in Multi-Agent Coordination Systems*

Registered at Zenodo: [doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18738379](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18738379)

SHA-256 integrity hash is embedded in the document. All hypothesis tests, effect size thresholds,
and falsification criteria were committed before data collection began. Run 11 (seed=42, 500 epochs)
is declared pilot data and is excluded from confirmatory analysis.

## Reference Documents

**`Project Synapse — User Guide.docx`** — Non-technical walkthrough of the Lab Notebook and
Neural Loom interfaces. Intended for collaborators and reviewers unfamiliar with the codebase.

**`Project Synapse — Technical Reference.docx`** — Architecture overview, API endpoints, metric
definitions, data schemas, and hash chain integrity model. Intended for developers and peer reviewers.

## Theory

**`theory/`** — Reserved for theoretical working documents, literature notes, and paper drafts
as the confirmatory experiment progresses.

Key theoretical grounding:
- Puchtel (2026), *AnnA: Adaptive, non-neural Axiom* — intelligence as coherence under pressure;
  provides deductive basis for why Δ-variables must emerge under coordination constraints
- Puchtel (2026), *Intelligence Beyond Neurons* (Ch. 1–6) — substrate-independent account of
  regulation without command; explicit mapping to Cross-Origin-Constraint simulation behaviours
